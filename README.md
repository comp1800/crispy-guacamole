The file misc_demo.html contains a collection of miscellaneous functions 
from our lecture or from lab (typically based on student questions).

To try these examples out yourself:

<ol> 
<li> Clone or download this repository
<l1> Paste your firebase SDK information into the firebase_api_yourname.js file
<li> Rename that file with your name, or teams name, eg. firebase_config_team09.js or firebase_api_elmo.js
<li> Edit all the HTML files so that it sources your renamed config file:
     <script src="./firebase_api_team09.js"> </script>
     <script src="./firebase_api_elmo.js"> </script>
<li> Edit misc_demo.html
     Comment out the functions you are not using;
     Only call the ones you are trying out.
